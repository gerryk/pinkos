== Is PinkOS communist? ==

No.

== Is PinkOS really an OS? ==

It depends on your definition.
PinkOS does not do threads, processes, memory management or privilege separation. It doesn't dynamically load code.

If you want a "real operating system" for the CC1110, look at Keith Packard's [http://keithp.com/git?p=altos.git;a=tree AltOS], the AltusMetrum 8051 operating system.

== How do I load PinkOS onto a board? ==

You need a Chipcon device programmer. I use a GoodFET. SmartRF and CCFlasher are other options.
