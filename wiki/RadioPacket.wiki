#summary Radio packet format

All packets have the following header:

{{{
typedef struct
{
    uint8_t len;
    uint8_t dstAddr;
    uint8_t srcAddr;
    uint8_t seq;
    uint8_t type;
} packet_t;
}}}

The top bit of the sequence number is the request ACK flag.

A message of type 0 is an ACK and will have an empty payload.


All packets end with a 16bit CRC.
